# word-list-generator
word list generator
When you run this script, it will prompt the user to enter the number of words to generate and the size of each word. The script will then generate a list of random words, where the number of words and the length of each word depend on the user's input.

You can modify the script to adjust the range of word length or add more options as needed.
